# Battleship
## Welcome to Battleship!

To play Battleship, you will first need to set your board. Set your pieces one at a time: first choose the starting square by entering the x-coordinate (A-K) and the y-coordinate (1-9). Then, choose the orientation of your ship: entering 1 will place your ship horizontally, and entering 2 will place your ship vertically. _Hint: if you'd rather position your ships at random, you can click the "Surprise me!" button._

After all of your ships are in position, it's time to face your opponent! You can aim at the enemy's board by entering the target coordinates under _Bombs away_ and clicking _Take your shot_ (or pressing Enter). If you successfully hit your target, the location will show a red marker. If you miss your target, you will see a white marker. 

After you take a shot, it's your opponent's turn! If the enemy aims successfully, a red marker will appear on your ship. If the enemy misses, a white marker will appear where the shot landed.

When every target on a ship has been hit, the ship will sink! Whoever sinks all of the ships first wins the game. Careful, your opponent is smarter than they look!
